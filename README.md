# CS-adv

## Demo code for training our CS-adv on Office-Home

The core part of CS divergence is in CSutils.py.

In order to train the model, please download the Office-Home dataset from the official website. 

Then modify the data path in line 211 in train_image_officehome_cs.py. 

### Run 
sh run_office_home.sh  will train the Art to Clipart task by default.
